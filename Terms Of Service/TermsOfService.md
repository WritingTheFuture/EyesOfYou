By accessing or using Eyes Of You ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to all these terms, you may not use the app.

## 2. Description of Service
Eyes Of You is a visual assistance application that uses computer vision technologies to help users identify objects, text, and distances in their surroundings. Key visual processing features operate **locally on your device**. The app requires camera access, and this data is processed on-device by machine learning models. **We do not transmit or store your camera data or the data generated by these local processing features on our servers.**

## 3. Data Privacy
The app does not require a user account. All data is processed entirely on your device and never leaves it. If you voluntarily contact us via email, your email address and the content of your message will be shared with us.

## 4. User Responsibilities
You agree to:
*   Use the app in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
*   Not to use the app for any illegal or unauthorized purpose
*   Not to interfere with or disrupt the app's functionality
*   Take full responsibility for how you choose to use the information provided by the app

## 5. Safety and Disclaimers
Eyes Of You is intended to be an assistance tool only. The app should not be relied upon in situations where errors or inaccuracies could lead to danger, harm, or property damage. Do not use the app while operating vehicles or machinery, or in any situation that requires your full attention to safety.

While we strive for accuracy, the app's object detection, distance measurements, and text recognition may contain errors. You acknowledge that computer vision systems are not perfect and agree to use your own judgment in addition to the app's information.

You are solely responsible for your use of the app and the decisions you make based on the information it provides. We shall not be held responsible or liable for any actions taken, or consequences that arise, from your reliance on the app.

## 6. Intellectual Property
The app, including its content, features, and functionality, is owned by us and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the app without our written permission.

## 7. Privacy
Your use of the app is also governed by our Privacy Policy. The app operates entirely offline; we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your data. If you choose to email us for feedback or support, your email address and message will be shared with us.

## 8. Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms at any time by posting updated Terms to the app. Your continued use of the app after any changes indicates your acceptance of the modified Terms.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenue, resulting from your use of the app.

## 10. Governing Law
These Terms and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales.

You agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter or formation.

# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: 5th of June, 2025.*

## 1. Introduction
Eyes Of You is a visual assistance application that uses computer vision technologies to help users understand their surroundings. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our app. We are committed to your privacy and ensure that core visual processing features operate locally on your device.

## 2. How Your Data is Handled by the App
**Camera Data:** The app requires access to your device's camera to perform real-time object detection, classification, text recognition, semantic segmentation. All camera images and derived data from these features are processed **locally on your device**. This data is **never transmitted to our servers or any third party**, and is not stored by us.

**Voice Assistant Data:** When you use the voice assistant feature, the app accesses your device's microphone to process voice commands. Voice recognition is handled through Apple's Speech framework, which may process audio data either on-device or through Apple's servers depending on your circumstances. **We do not store or transmit your voice data to our servers.** All voice command processing and app navigation happens locally within the app. Voice-to-speech responses are generated entirely on-device using Apple's built-in text-to-speech engine.

**Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect and store your **username and email address**. We also record your **sign-up date, last login date, and the sign-in method** you used (e.g., email/password, Google, Apple). This information is used solely for account management, authentication. We **do not** collect or store any other personal information from your device or third-party sign-in providers beyond what is stated here.

## 3. Our Purposes for Processing Your Data
The app interacts with your data for the following purposes. The specific location of this processing (primarily on your device for core features, or on our servers for account management) is detailed in Section 4:

*   To provide computer vision features for identifying objects, text, and distances in your environment
*   To enable voice-controlled navigation and accessibility features through the voice assistant
*   To authenticate your account and maintain your session
*   To enable alert rules you've configured for specific detected objects
*   To troubleshoot issues and provide customer support

## 4. Data Processing and Storage
**On-Device Processing:** All core visual assistance features, including object detection, classification, text recognition, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, perform their processing **entirely on your device**. The machine learning models run locally. Camera data and data generated by these features are **not sent to our servers or any third party**.

**Voice Assistant Processing:** The voice assistant uses Apple's Speech framework for speech recognition and Apple's AVSpeechSynthesizer for text-to-speech. Speech-to-text processing may occur on-device or through Apple's servers depending on your device model, iOS version, and system settings. Text-to-speech responses are generated entirely on-device. Voice command interpretation and app navigation occur locally within the app. **We do not process, store, or have access to your voice data.**

## 5. Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We may share limited data with:
*   Legal authorities if required by law or to protect our rights

## 6. Your Rights and Choices
You can:
*    Access your account information (such as email address and sign-in method) through the Profile section of the app.
*    Request deletion of your entire account by contacting us or by using the account deletion feature found in the Settings section of the app. Deleting your account will remove the account information we store (email address, sign-in method, UserID, account creation date, last sign-in date) from our servers.
*   Control camera and microphone permissions through your device settings
*   Enable or disable the voice assistant feature within the app
*   Request a copy of your data by contacting us

## 7. Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, accidental loss, or damage.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.
